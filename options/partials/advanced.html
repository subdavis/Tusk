	<a href="https://w3c.github.io/webappsec-credential-management/">Chrome Credential API</a> allows JavaScript to interact in a limited way with the Chrome password manager.  If enabled in the browser, CKPX can use this to encourage Chrome to remember the passwords you use so that they become available in your browser without needing to use CKPX.  
	<br /><br />
	Chrome also syncs passwords between devices, so they should also become available on your mobile device or other computers.

  Unless you use the "remember password" option, CKPX can only keep your password file open in-memory for a very brief
  time, typically about 10 seconds after you close the popup.  This can be frustrating if you have a long
  password and you need to access several websites.

    <input id="diskCache" type="checkbox" ng-model="flags.useDiskCache" ng-change="updateDiskCacheFlag()"> <label for="diskCache">Use encrypted cache to keep database open longer</label>
  </pageInfo>
  Check the box above to enable disk-caching.  With this
  option enabled, an unlocked database is encrypted and stored locally so that
  you don't have to re-type your password for each website.  The cache expires
  automatically after about 40 minutes.
