# Contribution Guidelines

A more thorough set of contributing guidelines is fourthcoming, but here are the basics:

* We welcome new contributors, but always review code.
* Pull requests must address an issue in the issue tracker and be well-documented.
* Stick to the style.

## Style Guidelines

* Tusk is built around promise chains.  These have found to be applicable to most workflows
* Code re-use.  Vue makes it easier than ever to recycle code.  If you want to use it twice, factor it out.
* Comment with purpose.  Code should explain itself.  If you find a block of code needs explanation, consider rewriting it first, then comment.

## Issue Guidelines

* Feel free to open an issue about anything for any reason.
