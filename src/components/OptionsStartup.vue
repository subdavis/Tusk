      <p>
        Tusk helps you keep track of all your accounts by storing your passwords in an encrypted
        file called a Keepass Database. You choose where this file is stored - most people keep them
        in a cloud storage provider like Dropbox or Google Drive for easy access and syncing between
        laptops, desktops, and phones. To use Tusk, you should first enable one of the storage
        providers below.
      </p>

      <a class="waves-effect waves-light btn" @click="$router.route('/manage/databases')"
        >1. Cloud Storage Setup</a
      >

      <p>
        Optionally, you may also import any required keyfiles. A keyfile can be used together with a
        password to provide even better security, or even used instead of one.
      </p>

      <a class="waves-effect waves-light btn" @click="$router.route('/manage/keyfiles')"
        >2. Keyfile Setup (optional)</a
      >

      <p>
        That's it! Tusk will automatically discover any Keepass databases that your have in your
        cloud storage, and allow you to switch between databases from the browser popup.
      </p>

      <p>
        If you are a new Keepass user, you will be prompted to create a new database from the popup
        window after you enable a cloud storage provider. Most people keep all their passwords in a
        single database, so you will only need to do this once.
